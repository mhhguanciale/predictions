    <h1>Daily Memo (15-Feb-2026)</h1>
<h3>Key News Headlines</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Geopolitics/Energy:</strong> Trump and Netanyahu have agreed to increase pressure on Iranian oil exports, specifically targeting sales to China.</li>
<li><strong>Semiconductors:</strong> Micron Technology stock is surging; analysts suggest significant runway remains, drawing comparisons to Nvidia's trajectory.</li>
<li><strong>Immigration:</strong> DHS officials state no immediate plans for sweeping city-specific enforcement, though ICE activity remains a focal point following a controversial shooting in Minnesota.</li>
<li><strong>Climate/Insurance:</strong> Massive winter storm warnings issued for Tahoe/California (up to 8 feet of snow); potential disruption to regional travel and insurance claims.</li>
<li><strong>Finance:</strong> Wall Street bank CEO pay has hit post-2008 highs, signaling confidence in the financial sector's profitability despite macro headwinds.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Macro Thesis: The &quot;June Pivot&quot; &amp; The Bond Bull Case</h3>
<p>The market has decisively shifted its expectations regarding Federal Reserve policy. Prediction markets now price a <strong>92.5% probability of a pause</strong> at the March meeting, effectively killing the &quot;March Cut&quot; narrative. However, the probability of a rate cut by the <strong>June meeting has risen to ~75%</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rates &amp; Bonds:</strong> Despite the &quot;higher for longer&quot; front-end narrative, the long end of the curve is bidding. FRED data shows the 10Y Treasury yield compressing from 4.29% earlier in the month to <strong>4.09%</strong> as of Feb 12. This divergence suggests the bond market is front-running a slowdown or pricing in a geopolitical safety premium.
<ul>
<li><em>Actionable:</em> Duration exposure is becoming attractive. The risk/reward for long-term treasuries is improving as yields slide despite sticky short-term policy expectations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Inflation:</strong> Markets are pricing February annual inflation to come in around <strong>2.4%</strong>. This steady but elevated level supports the Fed's pause but leaves the door open for Q2 easing if labor softens further (unemployment currently steady at 4.3%).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Geopolitics &amp; Energy: The Iran Risk Premium</h3>
<p>The most significant asymmetric risk currently lies in the energy sector. The convergence of the Trump/Netanyahu agreement to squeeze Iranian oil and prediction markets showing a <strong>~45-50% probability of a US or Israel strike on Iran by June 30, 2026</strong>, creates a bullish setup for oil.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Second Order Effects:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Oil Supply:</strong> Any kinetic action or strict enforcement of sanctions removes supply from the market. With WTI hovering in the mid-$60s, the geopolitical risk premium is arguably underpriced.</li>
<li><strong>Defense:</strong> Continued conflict in Ukraine (Russia making tactical gains in Pokrovsk) and rising Middle East tensions reinforce the long-term bull case for defense primes and aerospace.</li>
<li><strong>China:</strong> If Iranian oil to China is cut off, China must bid for supply elsewhere, potentially driving up global benchmarks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Sector Watch: Technology &amp; AI</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Semiconductors:</strong> Nvidia earnings are the immediate volatility event (expected week of Feb 16). Markets are pricing in a <strong>91% chance of a beat</strong>. However, the &quot;beat and raise&quot; bar is incredibly high.
<ul>
<li><em>Micron:</em> The recent surge suggests capital rotation into memory/storage plays as second-derivative AI beneficiaries.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>AI Hardware:</strong> Prediction markets indicate a ~48% chance OpenAI announces a &quot;clip-on&quot; wearable in 2026. Keep an eye on consumer hardware partners or supply chain components for such devices.</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory Risk:</strong> There is an 83% probability the Supreme Court rules in favor of Trump firing FTC commissioners. This would be a massive tailwind for M&amp;A activity, specifically benefiting large-cap tech previously hamstrung by antitrust scrutiny.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Crypto &amp; Digital Assets</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bitcoin:</strong> Price action is consolidating between $60k-$70k. Markets are split on a breakout to $80k by month-end.</li>
<li><strong>Stablecoins:</strong> Watch for regulatory clarity. The market is pricing in high volume for stablecoins, which benefits the underlying L1s (Ethereum/Solana) due to gas usage, even if spot prices chop.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
