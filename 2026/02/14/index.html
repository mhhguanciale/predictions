<h3>Macroeconomic Themes</h3>
<p><strong>Fed Policy &amp; Rates: The &quot;Warsh&quot; Consensus</strong>
Markets have effectively priced in Kevin Warsh as the next Fed Chair with near certainty. Consequently, the rate cut narrative has shifted: a March cut is now viewed as highly unlikely, with consensus moving toward a &quot;pause&quot; in March and potential easing delayed until June.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Implication:</strong> The 10Y Treasury yield has softened to ~4.09% from recent highs, stabilizing equity valuations. However, the delay in cuts creates headwinds for small-caps ($IWM) and regional banks ($KRE) in the short term.</li>
<li><strong>Action:</strong> Maintain duration discipline; the &quot;higher for longer&quot; spring scenario favors quality balance sheets over leverage.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Geopolitical Risk Premium: Underpriced?</strong>
Despite the confirmation of a kinetic US operation in Venezuela and rising betting market activity regarding a US or Israeli strike on Iran in Q1 2026, broad market volatility (VIX) remains relatively suppressed.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Energy:</strong> WTI Crude is trading in the mid-$60s, which appears disconnected from the rising probability of supply chain disruptions in the Strait of Hormuz or further escalation in South America.</li>
<li><strong>Defense:</strong> The combination of the Venezuela raid and ongoing Ukraine friction supports a continued bullish thesis for defense primes ($ITA, $XAR).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Sector Watch</h3>
<p><strong>Technology &amp; AI ($QQQ, $XLK)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nvidia ($NVDA):</strong> Sentiment is overwhelmingly bullish heading into earnings, with markets pricing in a beat. The focus is shifting to the sustainability of margins and the release timeline for next-gen chips.</li>
<li><strong>Apple ($AAPL):</strong> Reports of foldable iPhone testing suggest a potential hardware super-cycle is in development (likely 2027). This is a positive signal for the supply chain ($SWKS, $QRVO) which has lagged.</li>
<li><strong>AI Regulation:</strong> The potential lawsuit against xAI regarding power plant emissions highlights a growing &quot;physical constraint&quot; risk for AI scaling. Utilities ($XLU) and green energy providers could see increased pricing power as data centers scramble for compliant power.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Healthcare ($XLV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vaccines:</strong> Expanding measles outbreaks in the US are generating headlines. While financially minor for giants like Merck ($MRK) or GSK ($GSK) relative to total revenue, the sentiment shift emphasizes the recurring revenue durability of vaccine portfolios.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Crypto &amp; Fintech</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Market Structure:</strong> Bitcoin remains range-bound ($60k-$70k) as the market digests ETF flows. Speculation regarding a Trump administration pivot on crypto regulation remains a primary driver for alt-coin volatility.</li>
<li><strong>Fintech:</strong> High expectations for payment processors ($FIS) to beat earnings suggest consumer transaction volume remains resilient despite macro headwinds.</li>
</ul>
