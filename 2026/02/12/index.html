<h2>1. Macro &amp; Rates</h2>
<h3>Growth / Recession Risk</h3>
<ul>
<li>Markets are effectively pricing <em>very low</em> odds of a U.S. recession in 2025 (negative GDP seen as unlikely).</li>
<li>Macro data:
<ul>
<li>Core CPI index rose from ~325.7 (Mar 2025) to ~331.9 (Dec), implying still-firm disinflation but not yet “mission accomplished.”</li>
<li>Core PCE index moved from 125.1 (Feb) to 127.4 (Nov), a steady but modest rise consistent with inflation gradually converging toward target.</li>
<li>Nonfarm payrolls are flat-to-slightly up: 158.5m (Apr 2025) → 158.6m (Jan 2026). No contraction, but clear loss of momentum vs earlier cycle.</li>
<li>Unemployment rate has drifted up from 4.2–4.3% in mid-2025 to 4.3–4.5% late 2025, back at 4.3% Jan 2026.</li>
<li>JOLTS job openings fell from ~7.7m (May 2025) to ~6.5m (Dec 2025) — labor demand cooling but not collapsing.</li>
<li>Industrial production has been gently rising (101.0 in Mar 2025 → 102.3 in Dec 2025).</li>
<li>Retail sales are plateauing (~$716–735bn per month Mar–Dec 2025), suggesting stable but not accelerating consumption.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Takeaway:
<ul>
<li>Soft-landing baseline still intact: moderate growth, mild labor softening, gradual disinflation.</li>
<li>Equities supported by “Goldilocks-lite,” but slow earnings growth and higher-for-longer real rates still cap multiples.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Positioning implications</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Duration:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fed Funds down from 4.33% (mid-2025) to 3.64% (Jan 2026). Market has already priced substantial easing.</li>
<li>2Y ~3.5% and 10Y ~4.2% with a positive 10Y–2Y spread (~0.7%). Curve has re-steepened without a recession — unusual but consistent with “insurance” cuts already delivered.</li>
<li>With Chicago Fed Financial Conditions Index steadily more negative (~-0.56), financial conditions are <em>very loose</em> vs history.</li>
<li>Risk: front end may be <em>too aggressive</em> on further cuts; long end vulnerable if fiscal worries resurface.</li>
<li>Bias: incremental steepener trades look less asymmetric now that the curve is already positive; focus shifts to outright rate level. Long duration can still work tactically into any CPI downside surprise, but risk-manage around inflation prints.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Equities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Macro backdrop is neutral-to-supportive for broad U.S. equities, but with downside skew if inflation re-firms or fiscal politics drive rate volatility.</li>
<li>Consumer exposure: flat retail and weak sentiment (Michigan sentiment stuck low 50s) argue for selectivity; prefer upper-income, pricing-power names over broad cyclicals.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>2. Fiscal Policy, Tax &amp; Trade</h2>
<h3>Federal Budget / Spending</h3>
<ul>
<li>Prediction markets price <strong>very low odds</strong> of large discretionary cuts or deep percentage reductions in 2025 federal spending.</li>
<li>With core inflation still positive and M2 rising (from ~21.6T Mar 2025 to 22.4T Dec 2025), any <em>actual</em> large fiscal tightening would be disinflationary and bullish for duration, bearish for cyclicals — but current odds suggest status quo: large deficits, no meaningful consolidation.</li>
<li>House vote to cancel Canada tariffs — with GOP defections — reveals:
<ul>
<li>Congressional appetite to constrain Trump’s more extreme trade agenda when it directly hits allies and domestic importers.</li>
<li>This moderates tail risk of across-the-board tariff shocks, though China-focused or “strategic” tariffs remain live.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Tax Revenue &amp; Tariffs</h3>
<ul>
<li>Market expectations around 2025 federal revenue appear internally inconsistent with historical baselines (numbers provided are far below actual historical collections). Interpreting directionally:
<ul>
<li>Traders clearly expect <em>no revenue windfall</em> via tax hikes or massive new tariffs.</li>
<li>Tariffs generating &gt;$250b in 2025 seen as unlikely, consistent with:
<ul>
<li>Congressional resistance (as seen with Canada).</li>
<li>Concern that broad tariffs would be inflationary and politically painful.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Implications:
<ul>
<li>Deficits likely remain wide; upward pressure on term premia over time (10Y) still a structural theme.</li>
<li>For equities: near-term relief for importers/retailers and multinationals that would have borne tariff costs; keep an eye on sector-specific tariffs (EVs, batteries, semis).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Positioning</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Prefer:
<ul>
<li>Quality growth and secular winners that can navigate a noisy but ultimately pro-deficit, low-consolidation regime.</li>
<li>Names sensitive to cross-border supply chains still face policy headline risk, but Canada-specific tariff overhang is easing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>3. Politics &amp; Policy: U.S.</h2>
<h3>Immigration Policy</h3>
<ul>
<li>Markets lean toward <strong>large-scale deportations (250–500k in 2025) as baseline</strong>, but consider very extreme numbers (&gt;750k) as low probability.</li>
<li>News flow: immigration crackdown in Minnesota, high-profile ICE detention cases, protests targeting corporations (e.g., Target) indicate:
<ul>
<li>Implementation friction and legal challenges.</li>
<li>Corporate and consumer backlash, especially in blue and swing states.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Macro / sector effects:
<ul>
<li>Labor supply: aggressive deportations focused on low-skill sectors (agriculture, construction, services) could:
<ul>
<li>Tighten labor markets at the low end, supporting wage inflation in those segments.</li>
<li>Put pressure on margins in labor-intensive industries (restaurants, hospitality, some logistics, homebuilding).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Housing:
<ul>
<li>Reduced household formation at the margin could dampen rental demand in certain regions, but scale is probably not macro-changing relative to national population.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Political:
<ul>
<li>Heightened polarization raises tail risk around mid-2026 fiscal/debt fights and immigration-related shutdown threats.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Positioning</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Underweight:
<ul>
<li>Pure-play U.S. labor-intensive low-margin consumer services with high undocumented workforce exposure.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Overweight / favor:
<ul>
<li>Automation beneficiaries (software, robotics) and companies providing compliance/identity solutions.</li>
<li>Select REITs tilted to higher-income tenants and less dependent on migrant household formation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>U.S. Congress &amp; 2026 Balance of Power</h3>
<ul>
<li>Markets see:
<ul>
<li>Republicans modestly favored for the Senate in 2026.</li>
<li>Democrats strongly favored for the House.</li>
<li>Split Congress (R Senate / D House) roughly as likely as unified Democratic control.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Implications:
<ul>
<li>2027–2028 policy likely gridlocked on big-ticket items: major tax reform, broad healthcare overhaul, large new climate packages.</li>
<li>Regulatory risk shifts to:
<ul>
<li>Agency/Executive actions (antitrust, tech, energy permitting).</li>
<li>Use of oversight and investigations rather than legislation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Positioning</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Healthcare:
<ul>
<li>Lower risk of sweeping Medicare/drug-pricing reforms; environment still tough but incremental rather than structural.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tech/AI:
<ul>
<li>Legislative crackdowns remain unlikely; risk is more in targeted antitrust, data-privacy, and AI-safety frameworks from regulators and states.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Trump Presidency Stability (Through 2026)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Markets assign:
<ul>
<li>Non-trivial probability that Trump leaves office before a noted entertainment benchmark, and low but notable odds of impeachment or resignation by end-2026.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Combined with:
<ul>
<li>Active intra-GOP rebellion on some economic issues (tariffs).</li>
<li>Contentious moves around voting rules (SAVE Act).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Implications:
<ul>
<li>Elevated policy uncertainty premium for:
<ul>
<li>Treasuries (term premium).</li>
<li>Sectors most exposed to executive discretion: immigration, energy/environmental rollback, trade.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>But base case remains Trump in office through 2026.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Positioning</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid heavy concentration in single-policy “winners” (e.g., purely deregulation winners) that would be hurt if there’s a sudden leadership change.</li>
<li>Consider some hedging via:
<ul>
<li>Duration and USD exposure as “flight to quality” if a political shock surfaces.</li>
<li>Defense/energy as geopolitical risk hedges, especially given concurrent Middle East tensions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>4. Geopolitics &amp; Commodities</h2>
<h3>Russia–Ukraine</h3>
<ul>
<li>Markets lean toward:
<ul>
<li>Ceasefire before 2027 more likely than not, but unlikely by March 2026.</li>
<li>Moderate probability of ceasefire by end-2026, implying grinding conflict near term with some chance of later stabilization.</li>
<li>Low odds of Putin being out by 2026, but not zero.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>News: Russia restricting Telegram/Starlink frontlines; reports of operational chaos; Moscow preparing to evacuate tourists from Cuba amid U.S. oil blockade.</li>
<li>Oil:
<ul>
<li>WTI ~low $60s–mid $60s; conflict has been partially priced in and then normalized.</li>
<li>Ceasefire scenario:
<ul>
<li>Bearish for oil and some defense names longer term as war premium fades, but:</li>
<li>Could be offset by renewed Ukraine reconstruction demand (steel, industrials, European materials) and reduced European energy insecurity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Near term:
<ul>
<li>Continuing conflict supports modest floor under oil, grains, and defense procurement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Positioning</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Keep moderate exposure to:
<ul>
<li>Energy producers with low-cost barrels and strong balance sheets.</li>
<li>Defense primes and key subsystem suppliers (missiles, ISR, C2), which benefit both from Ukraine support and broader NATO rearmament.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Middle East (Iran, Israel, U.S.)</h3>
<ul>
<li>News:
<ul>
<li>Pentagon preparing to deploy a second carrier to the region.</li>
<li>Trump hinting at “very tough” options if Iran talks fail; yet expressing preference for a deal over war.</li>
<li>Netanyahu under political pressure at home, with a non-trivial chance of being out by end-2026, though markets view status quo as slightly more likely.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Implications:
<ul>
<li>Near-term escalation risk elevated (accidental clash, proxy engagements). Tail risk of Iranian supply disruption is non-zero, but well below 2020-esque levels given global spare capacity and current prices.</li>
<li>Medium-term, political shifts in Israel (Netanyahu exit) could modulate regional temperature but not eliminate risk.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Positioning</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Energy:
<ul>
<li>Retain some oil/commodity exposure as geopolitical hedge; current sub-$70 WTI provides limited downside vs historical cycles.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Defense:
<ul>
<li>Additional U.S. deployments and ongoing Iran/Israel tensions support U.S. Navy/Air Force–heavy contractors and missile-defense suppliers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>China–Taiwan / East Asia</h3>
<ul>
<li>Markets:
<ul>
<li>Low but meaningful probability of China invading Taiwan by end-2026; somewhat higher probability of some form of crisis before the GTA benchmark.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Implications:
<ul>
<li>Semiconductor and advanced hardware supply chains remain structurally fragile.</li>
<li>Even without invasion, the <em>perceived</em> risk supports:
<ul>
<li>Onshoring/friendshoring capex in U.S., Japan, Europe, India.</li>
<li>Government incentives for non-Taiwan advanced fabs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Xi Jinping ouster probability by 2027 is low but not de minimis, hinting at recognition of internal stresses (growth, demographics, property).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Positioning</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Semiconductors:
<ul>
<li>Favor geographically diversified chipmakers and equipment names with broad customer bases; structural winners from capex race.</li>
<li>Avoid overconcentration in pure Taiwan geopolitical risk.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Defense:
<ul>
<li>Asia-Pacific focus (naval, air, cyber) remains a secular growth theme.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>EM / China:
<ul>
<li>Be cautious on China-specific equity beta; political and property overhangs plus leadership entrenchment argue for selective, not broad, exposure.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>5. Sector Views</h2>
<h3>Technology &amp; AI</h3>
<ul>
<li>AI hardware:
<ul>
<li>Markets see low probability that a major AI lab launches consumer hardware by Mar 2026.</li>
<li>Suggests:
<ul>
<li>AI monetization remains weighted to cloud, enterprise, and developer tools rather than mass-market gadgets.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cybersecurity:
<ul>
<li>Microsoft’s disclosure of multiple critical zero-days actively exploited:
<ul>
<li>Strengthens secular thesis for security spending (endpoint, identity, zero-trust, incident response).</li>
<li>Large platforms may bear short-term patching reputational risk but also reinforce “too embedded to displace” status.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Real Estate Services:
<ul>
<li>Sharp selloff across CRE services on AI disruption fears:
<ul>
<li>Current fundamentals: high rates, pressure on office/utilization trends, cost-cutting by occupiers.</li>
<li>AI adds structural headwind to transaction-heavy, advisory-heavy fee pools (lease brokerage, valuation, research).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Net effect:
<ul>
<li>Tech remains core leadership, but AI winners are consolidating at the platform and infra layer; downstream services scramble to adapt.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Positioning</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Overweight:
<ul>
<li>Cloud, semis, AI infrastructure, cyber.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Neutral-to-underweight:
<ul>
<li>CRE service companies and other middleman business models with high information asymmetry risk from AI.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Selective:
<ul>
<li>Consumer hardware: no near-term AI-device supercycle; focus on firms with strong ecosystems and subscription revenue.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Healthcare &amp; Public Health</h3>
<ul>
<li>Macro:
<ul>
<li>AMA’s move to create its own vaccine-effectiveness review reflects deep public trust issues; government perceived as stepping back from centralized guidance.</li>
<li>Active measles outbreaks in SC and FL (college environments) drive near-term vaccine and testing demand.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Policy:
<ul>
<li>With split-government expectations in 2026 and low odds of large budget cuts, structural public-health funding likely persists but with politicized allocation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Positioning</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Favor:
<ul>
<li>Vaccine/platform players and diagnostics tied to outbreaks.</li>
<li>Managed care and diversified healthcare services: regulatory risk muted by expected gridlock.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Risk:
<ul>
<li>Policy volatility at state level (mandates, restrictions) can affect hospital systems and universities regionally.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Energy &amp; Commodities</h3>
<ul>
<li>WTI in the mid-$60s with:
<ul>
<li>Ongoing war in Ukraine.</li>
<li>Elevated Middle East tensions, but also U.S. oil blockade pressures in Cuba and modest demand growth.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Markets price moderate odds of geopolitical regime changes (Putin, Netanyahu) and conflict ceasefires by 2026; net effect:
<ul>
<li>Medium-term risk premium in oil is persistent but not extreme.</li>
<li>Any surprise ceasefire in Ukraine or Iran nuclear deal could shave a meaningful premium off oil; conversely, a miscalculation in Persian Gulf would quickly spike prices.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Positioning</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Maintain:
<ul>
<li>Core allocation to energy producers and integrated majors, emphasizing low-cost, strong FCF, and shareholder-return discipline.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tactical:
<ul>
<li>Consider optionality (calls or high-beta producers) as a hedge against a Middle East supply shock around carrier deployments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Real Estate &amp; Housing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Housing starts have drifted lower (1.49m Feb 2025 → 1.25m Oct 2025), while Case-Shiller home prices resumed a slow grind higher late 2025.</li>
<li>Higher-for-longer real rates + constrained supply:
<ul>
<li>Support home prices.</li>
<li>Limit new construction.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>AI scare trade in CRE services:
<ul>
<li>Structural profitability questions for brokers and advisory-heavy firms; near term also cyclically challenged if transaction volumes stay weak.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Positioning</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Residential:
<ul>
<li>Prefer platforms and suppliers to tight existing-home markets (home improvement, select building products) over pure homebuilders at this stage of the cycle.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>CRE:
<ul>
<li>Be cautious on office-/brokerage-heavy names; better risk/reward in industrial/logistics-focused real estate and debt-backed structures with strong underwriting.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Autos / EVs</h3>
<ul>
<li>Toyota’s 3-row Highlander EV reveal for 2027 (320-mile range) signals:
<ul>
<li>Legacy OEMs committing to mass-market family EVs with practical range and mainstream branding.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Implications:
<ul>
<li>Competitive pressure increases on pure-play EV makers and higher-end legacy EV lines by late decade.</li>
<li>Battery, materials, and charging infrastructure demand remain secular tailwinds, with more diversified customer mix.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Positioning</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Favor:
<ul>
<li>Battery materials, power semis, and charging infra.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Selective:
<ul>
<li>EV OEMs — differentiate those with brand power and cost advantage from those facing mid-decade margin compression.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>6. Crypto &amp; Digital Assets</h2>
<ul>
<li>Markets see:
<ul>
<li>Reasonable chance that a high-profile Ethereum-aligned project (MegaETH) launches with multibillion FDV and executes an airdrop by mid-2026.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Implications:
<ul>
<li>Ongoing appetite for high-beta crypto projects and airdrop farming.</li>
<li>Reinforces structural demand for crypto infrastructure, exchanges, and L2 / smart-contract ecosystems.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Macro overlay:
<ul>
<li>Looser financial conditions and positive risk sentiment (equities near highs, low recession odds) support risk-on crypto regimes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Positioning</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Consider:
<ul>
<li>Measured allocation to liquid large-cap crypto as a leveraged risk-on macro expression.</li>
<li>Avoid over-concentration in single speculative tokens; focus on platforms that benefit from high on-chain activity (L1, L2, trading infra).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>7. Sports Betting / Legal</h2>
<ul>
<li>SCOTUS has a modest chance of taking a sports-event contract case by mid-2026.</li>
<li>If granted cert:
<ul>
<li>Could reshape enforceability of certain sports-betting and media-rights contracts, affecting U.S.-listed gaming and media rights-exposed firms.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For now, this is a secondary risk, but:
<ul>
<li>Option value exists in diversified gaming operators with broad exposure and legal sophistication.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Upcoming Catalysts</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>2026-02-19 – January 2026 US CPI release</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Key for validating soft-landing narrative; downside surprise supports duration and growth/secular tech; upside would reprice Fed path and pressure long-duration equities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>2026-02-26 – US Q4 2025 GDP second estimate</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Confirms or revises growth trajectory; meaningful downward revision would favor defensives, rates; upside revision supports cyclicals.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>2026-02-27 – January 2026 US PCE inflation release</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fed’s preferred gauge; any re-acceleration vs trend would push back rate-cut expectations and steepen bearishly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>2026-03-03 – US 2026 Presidential primary Super Tuesday</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sets de facto 2026–2028 policy menu (tax, healthcare, energy, trade); sector moves likely in healthcare, defense, and energy policy-exposed names.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Early March 2026 – US ISM Manufacturing and Services PMIs</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Timely gauge of cyclical momentum; sub-50 prints would favor defensives and bonds, strong readings favor cyclicals and commodities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>2026-03-06 – US January 2026 Employment Situation (jobs report)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Labor-softening vs wage growth mix will drive front-end yields and equity sector rotation (cyclicals vs growth).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>2026-03-06, 2026-04-03, 2026-05-08 – US Nonfarm Payrolls &amp; unemployment data</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sequential confirmation/refutation of soft-landing base case; sustained labor weakening would support longer duration and defensives.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>2026-03-12 – ECB Governing Council rate decision</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Impacts EURUSD and relative performance of U.S. vs European multinationals; dovish ECB would support stronger USD and U.S. megacaps.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>2026-03-18 – February 2026 FOMC meeting and press conference</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Key for validating the current easing trajectory; any pushback on market pricing could hit growth stocks and EM risk.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>2026-03-19 – Bank of Japan monetary policy meeting</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Any further normalization impacts JPY and global carry trades; sudden JPY strength could pressure risk assets and U.S. financials with Japan exposure.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Monthly Feb–May 2026 – Key US inflation prints (CPI/PPI/PCE)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Determine the pace and depth of future Fed cuts; persistent upside surprises would weigh on long-duration assets across equities and bonds.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Early May 2026 – US Treasury Quarterly Refunding Announcement (QRA)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Signals net duration supply; larger-than-expected long-end issuance would steepen curves and pressure long-dated Treasuries and rate-sensitive equities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Likely Q2 2026 – US debt ceiling / government funding deadline</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Potential volatility shock in rates, USD, and domestically-focused cyclicals if brinkmanship intensifies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Late April 2026 (approx.) – Microsoft FY26 Q3 earnings</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Critical for cloud/AI narrative; drives broader large-cap tech and growth multiples.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Late April / Early May 2026 (approx.) – Apple FY26 Q2 earnings</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Read-through for global consumer hardware demand and ecosystem monetization.</li>
</ul>
