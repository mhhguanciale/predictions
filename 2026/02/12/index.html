    <h1>Daily Memo (12-Feb-2026)</h1>
<h3>Top News Headlines</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Geopolitics:</strong> Pentagon preparing to deploy a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East; Trump warns Iran of &quot;something very tough&quot; if talks fail, despite stating a preference for a deal.</li>
<li><strong>Cybersecurity:</strong> Microsoft confirms hackers are exploiting critical zero-day bugs targeting Windows/Office; bullish read-through for third-party cybersecurity vendors.</li>
<li><strong>Fiscal Policy:</strong> Trump administration moving to withhold ~$600M in public health funds from Democratic-led states; 4 states suing.</li>
<li><strong>Labor:</strong> NYC nurses at 4 hospitals vote to end strike, but walkout continues at NewYork-Presbyterian.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Macroeconomic Thesis: The &quot;No-Cut&quot; Reality &amp; Shutdown Risk</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fed Policy Outlook:</strong> Markets have effectively priced out a March rate cut (92% implied probability of a pause). Attention has shifted to a potential cut in June (76% probability).
<ul>
<li><strong>Chair Nomination:</strong> Kevin Warsh is the clear frontrunner for the next Fed Chair nomination (58% chance by Feb 28). A Warsh nomination would likely signal a regime shift toward deregulation but potentially tighter monetary adherence.</li>
<li><strong>Yields:</strong> 10Y Treasury yield recently dipped to 4.16% (FRED), but prediction markets show upward pressure, pricing a move toward 4.4%–4.5% by Q2 as the &quot;higher for longer&quot; reality sets in.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Fiscal Drag:</strong> A government shutdown starting around Feb 14 is now the base case (82% probability). While markets usually look through shutdowns, a duration of &gt;5 days (73% probability) could dampen Q1 GDP estimates and increase short-term volatility in defense contractors and government services.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Geopolitical Risk: Asymmetric Upside in Energy</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Middle East Escalation:</strong> There is a significant disconnect between WTI Crude prices (~$64/bbl) and the implied probability of kinetic conflict. Prediction markets are pricing a ~40% chance of a US/Israel strike on Iran by March 31.
<ul>
<li><strong>Trade:</strong> Energy ($XLE, $USO) appears mispriced relative to geopolitical risk. Downside is capped by the Strategic Petroleum Reserve refill floor (~$60s), while upside is uncapped on a Strait of Hormuz closure event (10% probability by March 31).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Defense Sector:</strong> With the Pentagon deploying additional assets and the Russia-Ukraine conflict showing no signs of a ceasefire before mid-year, defense primes ($XAR, $ITA) remain insulated from broader cyclical weakness.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Sector &amp; Equity Focus</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tech &amp; AI:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>NVIDIA ($NVDA):</strong> Earnings on Feb 19 are the critical near-term catalyst. Markets imply a ~90% chance of a beat. Positioning remains crowded, but fundamentals appear intact.</li>
<li><strong>Microsoft ($MSFT):</strong> The zero-day exploit news is a headline negative but highlights the necessity of the stack. Watch for rotation into pure-play cyber names (e.g., Palo Alto, CrowdStrike) as a hedge.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Healthcare ($XLV):</strong> Monitor the lawsuit regarding the $600M public health fund cut. While the dollar amount is negligible for the sector, it signals a hostile regulatory environment for hospital systems and state-dependent insurers in blue states.</li>
<li><strong>Crypto:</strong> Bitcoin is consolidating in the $60k-$70k range. Markets are pricing a higher probability of BTC outperforming Gold in 2026, but short-term volatility remains high with mixed ETF flows.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Upcoming Catalysts</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Feb 13 (Tomorrow):</strong> <strong>January 2026 U.S. CPI Release.</strong> <em>Critical for confirming the &quot;no March cut&quot; thesis; a hot print sends yields higher.</em></li>
<li><strong>Feb 14:</strong> <strong>US Government Funding Deadline.</strong> <em>High probability of shutdown; expect short-term volatility in government-adjacent sectors.</em></li>
<li><strong>Feb 18:</strong> <strong>FOMC Minutes (Jan Meeting).</strong> <em>Will provide color on the depth of the &quot;pause&quot; consensus.</em></li>
<li><strong>Feb 19:</strong> <strong>NVIDIA (NVDA) Q4 Earnings.</strong> <em>Market-moving event for the entire AI/Semi complex ($QQQ).</em></li>
<li><strong>Feb 19:</strong> <strong>January 2026 U.S. PPI Release.</strong> <em>Leading indicator for PCE; watch margins for industrials.</em></li>
<li><strong>Feb 28:</strong> <strong>U.S. January PCE Inflation Report.</strong> <em>The Fed's preferred metric; will dictate the path for the June meeting.</em></li>
<li><strong>Mar 06:</strong> <strong>U.S. February Jobs Report (NFP).</strong> <em>Labor market cracks are the only thing likely to bring rate cuts forward.</em></li>
<li><strong>Mar 18:</strong> <strong>FOMC Rate Decision &amp; Dot Plot.</strong> <em>Expectation is a hold; the Dot Plot update will be the primary mover for the 10Y yield.</em></li>
</ul>
