    <h1>Daily Memo (12-Feb-2026)</h1>
<h3>Key News Headlines</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Geopolitics &amp; Energy:</strong> US Energy Secretary Chris Wright is in Venezuela assessing oil industry overhaul, signaling a potential pivot in sanctions policy to offset Middle East supply risks. Meanwhile, oil prices are rising on escalating US-Iran tensions.</li>
<li><strong>Asia/Macro:</strong> Asian equities hit record highs; US yields and the dollar are lifting following strong jobs data. Japan's political landscape is shifting with Takaichi's rising influence, keeping investors wary of JPY volatility.</li>
<li><strong>Tech &amp; Cyber:</strong> Microsoft confirmed active exploitation of zero-day bugs targeting Windows/Office. TikTok faces renewed scrutiny over non-user tracking.</li>
<li><strong>Domestic Policy:</strong> The Trump administration is aggressively rolling back climate regulations (revoking EPA endangerment findings), prompting lawsuits from California and other states.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Macro Thesis: The &quot;Higher for Longer&quot; Q1 Repricing</h3>
<p>Current data suggests the market is aggressively pricing out a March Fed rate cut, shifting consensus toward a June pivot.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rates &amp; Bonds:</strong> With the 10-Year Treasury yield trending upward (currently ~4.16% per FRED data) and betting markets anticipating a move toward 4.4%-4.5% by quarter-end, duration exposure remains risky. Inflation data for January is expected to show stickiness (2.4%-2.6% range), reinforcing the Fed's pause.</li>
<li><strong>Growth:</strong> Despite rate headwinds, the economy remains resilient. Unemployment is steady at 4.3%, and nonfarm payrolls are holding up. The &quot;no landing&quot; scenario is gaining traction, which supports cyclical equities over defensive bond proxies ($ZROZ, $TLT).</li>
<li><strong>Action:</strong> Maintain short duration on fixed income. The rising yield environment creates a headwind for valuation-sensitive tech ($QQQ) but supports financials ($XLF) and industrials.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Sector Focus: Energy &amp; Defense (Geopolitical Hedge)</h3>
<p>The convergence of Middle East escalation risks and a US pivot on Venezuela creates a specific trade setup.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Iran Factor:</strong> Prediction markets are signaling a significantly elevated risk of kinetic military engagement between the US/Israel and Iran before the end of Q1. This geopolitical risk premium is not fully priced into crude oil ($DBC).</li>
<li><strong>The Venezuela Offset:</strong> The US Energy Secretary's visit to Venezuela suggests the administration is preparing a supply-side hedge. If Middle East lanes (Strait of Hormuz) are threatened, Venezuelan heavy crude becomes critical for US refiners.</li>
<li><strong>Defense:</strong> With NATO expanding Arctic operations (Greenland) and ongoing friction in Ukraine/Russia, the defense sector ($XAR) remains a structural long.</li>
<li><strong>Action:</strong> Overweight Energy ($XLE) and Defense. Monitor refiners that can process heavy sour crude as beneficiaries of a Venezuela deal.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Tech &amp; AI: The Model Wars &amp; The Trillion Dollar IPO</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI Leadership:</strong> Google ($GOOGL) is showing strength in recent benchmarks (FrontierMath), potentially closing the perception gap with OpenAI. With Grok 4.20 imminent, the model wars are intensifying, driving continued capex spend beneficial to Nvidia ($NVDA) and semi-cap equipment.</li>
<li><strong>Space Economy:</strong> Speculation regarding a SpaceX IPO is heating up for mid-to-late 2026, with valuations potentially exceeding $1T. This would be a massive liquidity event and sector-defining moment for aerospace.</li>
<li><strong>Cybersecurity:</strong> The Microsoft zero-day news underscores the necessity of cybersecurity spend. CrowdStrike ($CRWD) and Palo Alto ($PANW) remain critical infrastructure plays.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Crypto &amp; Digital Assets</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Market Structure:</strong> Bitcoin is consolidating in the $60k-$80k range. While short-term volatility is expected around mid-February options expiries, the medium-term outlook remains constructive.</li>
<li><strong>Adoption:</strong> Stablecoin market cap growth continues, signaling healthy on-chain liquidity.</li>
<li><strong>Action:</strong> Accumulate on dips toward the lower end of the channel ($60k).</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Upcoming Catalysts</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Feb 13 (Fri):</strong> Crypto Options Expiry/Volatility Window (Watch for BTC/ETH price swings).</li>
<li><strong>Feb 19 (Thu):</strong> January 2026 CPI Print (Critical for confirming the &quot;sticky inflation&quot; thesis).</li>
<li><strong>Feb 26 (Thu):</strong> US Q4 2025 GDP 2nd Estimate (Refining the &quot;no landing&quot; growth view).</li>
<li><strong>Feb 27 (Fri):</strong> January 2026 PCE Inflation (Fed's preferred metric).</li>
<li><strong>Feb 28 (Sat):</strong> Soft deadline for various geopolitical triggers regarding Iran/Israel escalation.</li>
<li><strong>Mar 06 (Fri):</strong> February 2026 US Jobs Report (Key for March FOMC expectations).</li>
<li><strong>Mar 18 (Wed):</strong> FOMC Meeting &amp; Press Conference (Expectation: Pause, hawkish tone).</li>
<li><strong>Spring 2026:</strong> NVIDIA GTC / AI Announcements (Data center demand check).</li>
<li><strong>Mid-2026:</strong> Potential SpaceX IPO filing window (Sector repricing event).</li>
